## Instructions

Download or clone the project. Open the index.html file in your favorite browser.

To play, click on a player icon at the bottom of the screen. This will trigger the
placement of three gems. The gems must be collected in the order of their
appearance. Touching a bug, the water at the top, or the wrong gem will restart
the game. If all gems are collected successfully, a new level with one more gem will
start. Winning the game requires collecting seven gems.
